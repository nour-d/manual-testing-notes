# Non-Functional Testing

Non-Functional Testing is intended to test the application to make sure it's usable. The tester isn't checking the functionality. Rather, they're looking at the speed, security, reliability.

For example, you have an email application. *Functional testing* may involve checking that the software can send and receive emails. *Non-Functional testing* may involve checking that the software can withstand normal or heavy traffic.

## Types of Non-Functional Testing

1. Load Testing
2. Stress Testing
3. Security Testing
4. Compatibility Testing
