# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

*Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)* - Also known as the Software Development Process, is a framework that provides a clear plan for how to develop and maintain a software project.

There are several different SDLC methodologies, the most popular being Waterfall and Agile.

## Waterfall

A *linear* approach to the SDLC. The product is released only after the earlier stage is approved. Waterfall can lack flexibility. The stages can be rigid, making the product difficult to adjust.

## Agile

A *repetitive* approach to the SDLC. The product is released in cycles, with client feedback getting incorporated with each new release. As a result, Agile is more flexible than Waterfall.
