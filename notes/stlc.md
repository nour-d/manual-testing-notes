# Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) consists of the *testing phases* of the [SDLC](../notes/sdlc.md).

## Phases

1. **Requirement Analysis** - The QA team will review and understand what is to be tested. They will also need to clarify anything that appears to be unclear.
2. **Test Planning** - The QA team will need to define the testing plan document and estimate time and costs.
3. **Test Design** - The QA team will design and review test cases. *Test cases are derived from vague test scenarios... test plan (all testing activities) -> test scenarios (one activity) -> test cases (one activity)*. 
4. **Setup Testing Environment** - The system Engineer or client will set up the testing environment. The testing environment should mimic the same conditions as the production environment.
5. **Test Execution** - Using *test cases* and the *testing environment*, the testers will now execute tests. This is the most important step: to ensure that the application is working properly as it should.
6. **Test Closure** - A document is created by the testers to review the completed test cases. It should include a list of all the discovered bugs. This is created before the testing process is officially complete.
