1. Check that all text fields accept input.
2. Check that the password field obstructs characters.
3. Check that the *Password confirmation* field obstructs characters.
4. Hover over the Sign Up button to confirm that it changes colors.
5. Click on the Sign Up button to confirm form submission.
6. Select the *Sign in* link to confirm users are redirected to the sign in page.
7. Submit the form using valid values. Check that a new user is made.
8. Submit the form using an invalid username. Confirm error message.
9. Submit the form using an invalid email address. Confirm error message.
10. Submit the form using an invalid password. Confirm error message.
11. Submit the form using a different password in the *Password confirmation* field. Confirm error message.
